h2. Configuring email

To get encrypted email to work, you have two options:

1. [[Bitmask Thunderbird Extension => https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/bitmask/]] (recommended)
2. Manual email client configuration

h3. Bitmask Thunderbird Extension

# Install Bitmask app and register for an account.
# Install the [[Bitmask Thunderbird Extension => https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/bitmask/]]. From within Thunderbird, select the menu items *Tools* > *Add Ons...* and then search for "Bitmask".
# Once the extension is installed, you can add an email account from the Thunderbird menu item *File* > *New* > *Bitmask Account...*

h3. Manual email client configuration

* IMAP -- @localhost:1984@
** *username*: the full email address you use with the Bitmask app.
** *password*: the password you'll find the email section Preferences window in bitmask.
** *SSL/TLS*: off
* SMTP -- @localhost:2013@
** *username*: the full email address you use with the Bitmask app.
** *password*: the password you'll find the email section Preferences window in bitmask.
** *SSL/TLS*: off

*Disable caching*: You should also disable any local caching in your email client, if applicable. All the data stored by Bitmask is kept on disk in an encrypted format, but any cache maintained by your mail client is probably less secure. Because all your Bitmask email is synchronized locally there is no benefit to local caching.
